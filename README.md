# Word Search Generator
A winforms app to automate generation of word search games

## Usage

Words are defined in the `WordSearchParams.cs` file. By convention there are 10 words per game but this isn't a hard and fast limit.

When the application starts, pressing `GENERATE` will have a go at filling the grid with the words the player needs to find. If you don't find the pattern that interesting, you can press `GENERATE` as many times as you like.

When you're happy with the grid, you can press `FILL` to add letters to the remaining empty squares on the grid.

You can then use the Snipping Tool or similar to grab the screen and print the puzzle out
