# Word Search Generator
A winforms app to automate generation of word search games

## Usage

Words are defined in the `WordSearchParams.cs` file. By convention there are 10 words per game but this isn't a hard and fast limit.

When the application starts, pressing `GENERATE` will have a go at filling the grid with the words the player needs to find. If you don't find the pattern that interesting, you can press `GENERATE` as many times as you like.

When you're happy with the grid, you can press `FILL` to add letters to the remaining empty squares on the grid.

You can then use the Snipping Tool or similar to grab the screen and print the puzzle out.

## Further Development

The initial application was thrown together in a weekend to entertain my children back in 2018, but there is considerable scope for development. There are a lot of [issues](https://github.com/Wycott/WordSearchGenerator/issues) ranging from minor to not-so-minor that new developers or hobbyists could use to cut their teeth on.
